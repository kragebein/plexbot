# Plexbot

Plexbot is sort of a bot that lets you easly search, add, delete, refresh, finetune your Plex library. 
It is entirely written in bash and supports plugins that can be written very easily in bash or whatever language you like to code in. 

The bot can run on just about any protocol your heart desire; irc, msn, facebook, discord, slack, shell, pushbullet, sms, skype, snapchat, telegram and beyond.
As long as the bot has a Linux system to run on and the requirements are met. 

The bot will communicate through json with, tautulli, sickrage, plex, couchpotato, thetvdb and imdb to do all this.
No action is needed on any of these systems when this bot is set up. Plexbot will sort, post process, and add the files to your system automatically. 



Requirements: [sickrage](https://github.com/SiCKRAGE/SiCKRAGE) [couchpotato](https://couchpota.to/) [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), [xml2json](https://github.com/hay/xml2json),[pup](https://github.com/ericchiang/pup), [x2j](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2json)
